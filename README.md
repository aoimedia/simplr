###A lightweight, no-float grid & typography starter kit with a minified build CSS file of 3.3KB.

###Credit
I built this as a fun experiment after reading Joshua Hibbert's post "Creating a Lightweight Grid System," where he demonstrated his preference for inline-block elements over floats.

I'm pushing the /dist files (the build, which would normally be ignored), just so I can auto-deploy that directory with Beanstalk every time I push.

It's always a work in progress.
